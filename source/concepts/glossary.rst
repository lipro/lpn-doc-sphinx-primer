Glossary
########

Sphinx has a built-in Glossary structure that you can use to:

* Produce a consolidated glossary of terms.
* Link terms in other content to their glossary definitions.

Create a Glossary
*****************

.. rst:directive:: glossary

   For more details, see :rst:dir:`sphinx:glossary` directive.

   To add glossary terms, you use the directive :rst:`.. glossary::`. Write
   each glossary entry as a definition list, with a term, followed by a
   single-line indented definition.

   Each glossary entry is nested below the :rst:`.. glossary::` directive.
   For example:

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. glossary::

          Sphinx
             Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and
             beautiful documentation. It was originally created for the
             Python documentation, and it has excellent facilities for the
             documentation of software projects in a range of languages.

          RST
             reStructuredText is an easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get
             plain text markup syntax and parser system. It is useful for
             in-line program documentation (such as Python docstrings), for
             quickly creating simple web pages, and for standalone documents.
             reStructuredText is designed for extensibility for specific
             application domains. The reStructuredText parser is a component
             of Docutils.

          Sublime Text
             Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup
             and prose. You'll love the slick user interface, extraordinary
             features and amazing performance.

Link a Term to its Glossary Entry
*********************************

.. rst:role:: term

   For more details, see :rst:role:`sphinx:index` role.

   When a glossary term is used in text, you can link it to its definition
   with the :rst:`:term:` role. For example, to link the term Sphinx to its
   definition, use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: rst

      :term:`Sphinx`

   The term specified must exactly match a term in Glossary directive.

   You can link to a term in the glossary while showing different text in the
   topic by including the term in angle brackets. For example:

   .. code-block:: rst

      :term:`reStructuredText<RST>`

   The term in angle brackets must exactly match a term in the glossary. The
   text before the angle brackets is what users see on the page.

.. Local variables:
   coding: utf-8
   mode: text
   mode: rst
   End:
   vim: fileencoding=utf-8 filetype=rst :
