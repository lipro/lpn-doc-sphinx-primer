   reStructuredText
      `reStructuredText`_ (**RST**, **ReST**, or **reST**) is a file format
      for textual data used primarily in the |Python| programming language
      community for technical documentation. It is part of the |Docutils|
      project of the |Python| Doc-SIG (Documentation Special Interest Group).

   Docutils
      `Docutils`_ is an open-source text processing system for processing
      plaintext documentation into useful formats, such as |HTML|, |LaTeX|,
      man-pages, open-document or |XML|. It includes |reStructuredText|, the
      easy to read, easy to use, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext
      markup language.

   Sphinx
      `Sphinx`_ is a documentation generator written and used by the |Python|
      community. It is written in |Python|, and also used in other environments.
      Sphinx converts |reStructuredText| files into |HTML| websites and other
      formats including PDF, EPub, Texinfo and man.
      
      |reStructuredText| is extensible, and Sphinx exploits its extensible
      nature through a number of extensions |--| for autogenerating
      documentation from source code, writing mathematical notation
      or highlighting source code, etc.

   LaTeX
      `LaTeX`_ is a document preparation system for high-quality
      typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical
      or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form
      of publishing. LaTeX uses the |TeX| typesetting program for
      formatting its output, and is itself written in the |TeX| macro
      language.

   C
      `C`_ is a general-purpose, imperative procedural computer programming
      language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and
      recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to
      provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map
      efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.
      C has been standardized by the |ANSI| *X3J11* since 1989 (**ANSI C**) and
      by the |ISO|/|IEC| JTC1/SC22/WG14 (**ISO C**).

   :abbr:`JS (JavaScript)`
   JavaScript
      :abbr:`JS (JavaScript)` is a programming language that conforms to the
      |ECMAScript| specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time
      compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic
      typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

      Alongside |HTML| and |CSS|, JavaScript is one of the core technologies
      of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is
      an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use
      it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a
      dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

   Python
      `Python`_ is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming
      language. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.
      A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, a free
      and open-source reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the
      Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and
      CPython development.
      
      CPython is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in |C|,
      meeting the |C|\ 89 standard with several select |C|\ 99 features.
      Python's development is conducted largely through the |PEP| process, the
      primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community
      input on issues and documenting Python design decisions. Python coding
      style is covered in :pep:`8`.
