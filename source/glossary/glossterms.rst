   reStructuredText
      `reStructuredText`_ (**RST**, **ReST**, or **reST**) is a file format
      for textual data used primarily in the Python programming language
      community for technical documentation. It is part of the |Docutils|
      project of the Python Doc-SIG (Documentation Special Interest Group)

   Docutils
      `Docutils`_ is an open-source text processing system for processing
      plaintext documentation into useful formats, such as HTML, LaTeX,
      man-pages, open-document or XML. It includes |reStructuredText|, the
      easy to read, easy to use, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext
      markup language.

   Sphinx
      `Sphinx`_ is a documentation generator written and used by the Python
      community. It is written in Python, and also used in other environments.
      Sphinx converts reStructuredText files into HTML websites and other
      formats including PDF, EPub, Texinfo and man.
      
      |reStructuredText| is extensible, and Sphinx exploits its extensible
      nature through a number of extensions |--| for autogenerating
      documentation from source code, writing mathematical notation
      or highlighting source code, etc.

   LaTeX
      `LaTeX`_ is a document preparation system for high-quality
      typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical
      or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form
      of publishing. LaTeX uses the |TeX| typesetting program for
      formatting its output, and is itself written in the |TeX| macro
      language.

   PGF
   TikZ
   PGF/TikZ
      `PGF/TikZ`_ is a pair of languages for producing vector graphics (for
      example: technical illustrations and drawings) from a geometric/algebraic
      description, with standard features including the drawing of points,
      lines, arrows, paths, circles, ellipses and polygons. PGF, the *Portable
      Graphic Format*, is a lower-level language, while TikZ, which is written
      in |TeX|, is a set of higher-level macros that use PGF.

   TeX
      `TeX`_ is a computer language designed for use in typesetting system;
      in particular, for typesetting math and other technical material. It
      has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical
      systems and is also used for many other typesetting tasks, especially
      in the form of |LaTeX|, ConTeXt, and other macro packages.
