   Sphinx
      `Sphinx`_ is a documentation generator written and used by the Python
      community. It is written in Python, and also used in other environments.
      Sphinx converts |reStructuredText| files into |HTML| websites and other
      formats including PDF, EPub, Texinfo and man.
      
      |reStructuredText| is extensible, and Sphinx exploits its extensible
      nature through a number of extensions |--| for autogenerating
      documentation from source code, writing mathematical notation
      or highlighting source code, etc.

   LaTeX
      `LaTeX`_ is a document preparation system for high-quality
      typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical
      or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form
      of publishing. LaTeX uses the |TeX| typesetting program for
      formatting its output, and is itself written in the |TeX| macro
      language.

   JS
   JavaScript
      :abbr:`JS (JavaScript)` is a programming language that conforms to the
      |ECMAScript| specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time
      compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic
      typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

      Alongside |HTML| and |CSS|, JavaScript is one of the core technologies
      of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is
      an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use
      it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a
      dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
