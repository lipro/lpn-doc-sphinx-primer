   reStructuredText
      `reStructuredText`_ (**RST**, **ReST**, or **reST**) is a file format
      for textual data used primarily in the |Python| programming language
      community for technical documentation. It is part of the |Docutils|
      project of the |Python| Doc-SIG (Documentation Special Interest Group).

   Docutils
      `Docutils`_ is an open-source text processing system for processing
      plaintext documentation into useful formats, such as |HTML|, |LaTeX|,
      man-pages, open-document or XML. It includes |reStructuredText|, the
      easy to read, easy to use, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext
      markup language.

   Sphinx
      `Sphinx`_ is a documentation generator written and used by the |Python|
      community. It is written in |Python|, and also used in other environments.
      Sphinx converts |reStructuredText| files into |HTML| websites and other
      formats including PDF, EPub, Texinfo and man.
      
      |reStructuredText| is extensible, and Sphinx exploits its extensible
      nature through a number of extensions |--| for autogenerating
      documentation from source code, writing mathematical notation
      or highlighting source code, etc.

   LaTeX
      `LaTeX`_ is a document preparation system for high-quality
      typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical
      or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form
      of publishing. LaTeX uses the |TeX| typesetting program for
      formatting its output, and is itself written in the |TeX| macro
      language.

   C
      `C`_ is a general-purpose, imperative procedural computer programming
      language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and
      recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to
      provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map
      efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.
      C has been standardized by the |ANSI| *X3J11* since 1989 (**ANSI C**) and
      by the |ISO|/|IEC| JTC1/SC22/WG14 (**ISO C**).

   C++
      `C++`_ is a general-purpose programming language as an extension of the
      |C| programming language, or *"C with Classes"*. Modern C++ implementations
      now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to
      facilities for low-level memory manipulation. C++ is standardized by the
      |ISO|/|IEC| JTC1/SC22/WG14 since 1998.

   ES
   ECMAScript
      :abbr:`ES (ECMAScript)` is a general-purpose programming language,
      standardized by `Ecma International`_ according to the document
      `ECMA-262`_. It is a |JavaScript| standard meant to ensure the
      interoperability of Web pages across different Web browsers.

   JS
   JavaScript
      :abbr:`JS (JavaScript)` is a programming language that conforms to the
      |ECMAScript| specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time
      compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic
      typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

      Alongside |HTML| and |CSS|, JavaScript is one of the core technologies
      of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is
      an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use
      it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a
      dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

   Python
      `Python`_ is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming
      language. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.
      A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, a free
      and open-source reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the
      Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and
      CPython development

   PGF/TikZ
      `PGF/TikZ`_ is a pair of languages for producing vector graphics (for
      example: technical illustrations and drawings) from a geometric/algebraic
      description, with standard features including the drawing of points,
      lines, arrows, paths, circles, ellipses and polygons. :abbr:`PGF (Portable
      Graphic Format)`, is a lower-level language, while TikZ, which is written
      in |TeX|, is a set of higher-level macros that use PGF.

   TeX
      `TeX`_ is a computer language designed for use in typesetting system;
      in particular, for typesetting math and other technical material. It
      has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical
      systems and is also used for many other typesetting tasks, especially
      in the form of |LaTeX|, ConTeXt, and other macro packages.
