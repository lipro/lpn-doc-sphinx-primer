      `reStructuredText`_ (**RST**, **ReST**, or **reST**) is a file format
      for textual data used primarily in the |Python| programming language
      community for technical documentation. It is part of the |Docutils|
      project of the |Python| Doc-SIG (Documentation Special Interest Group).

   Docutils
      `Docutils`_ is an open-source text processing system for processing
      plaintext documentation into useful formats, such as |HTML|, |LaTeX|,
      man-pages, open-document or |XML|. It includes |reStructuredText|, the
      easy to read, easy to use, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext

   Sphinx
      `Sphinx`_ is a documentation generator written and used by the |Python|
      community. It is written in |Python|, and also used in other environments.
      Sphinx converts |reStructuredText| files into |HTML| websites and other
      formats including PDF, EPub, Texinfo and man.
      
      |reStructuredText| is extensible, and Sphinx exploits its extensible
      nature through a number of extensions |--| for auto generating
      documentation from source code, writing mathematical notation
      or highlighting source code, etc.

   LaTeX
      `LaTeX`_ is a document preparation system for high-quality
      typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical
      or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form
      of publishing. LaTeX uses the |TeX| typesetting program for
      formatting its output, and is itself written in the |TeX| macro
      language.

   :abbr:`POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)`
      `POSIX`_ is a family of standards specified by the |IEEE| Computer
      Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems.
      :abbr:`POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)` defines the
      |API|, along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for
      software compatibility with variants of |Unix| and other operating
      systems. :abbr:`POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)` has been
      standardized by the *Austin Group* since 1997 (|SUS|), and later since
      2001 by the |IEEE| Computer Society (**IEEE Std 1003.1**). Before 1997,
      POSIX comprised several standards.

   Unix
      `Unix`_ (trademarked as UNIX\ |tm|) is a family of multitasking,
      multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original
      |AT&T| Unix, development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs
      research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. The
      origins of Unix date back to the mid-1960s when the |MIT|, Bell Labs
      and |GE| were developing *Multics*, a time-sharing operating system
      for a 36-bit mainframe computer. In the late 1980s, an open operating
      system standardization effort now known as |POSIX| provided a common
      baseline for all operating systems; |IEEE| based |POSIX| around the
      common structure of the major competing variants of the Unix system,
      publishing the first |POSIX| standard in 1988. In the early 1990s, a
      separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium,
      the |COSE| initiative, which eventually became the |SUS| administered by
      *The Open Group*. Starting in 1998, *The Open Group* and |IEEE| started
      the *Austin Group*, to provide a common definition of |POSIX| and the
      |SUS|, which, by 2008, had become the *Open Group Base Specification*.

   Linux
   |GNU|/Linux
      `Linux`_ (trademarked as Linux\ |tm|, handled by the |LMI|) is a family
      of open source |Unix|-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel,
      an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by
      Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.
      Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software
      and libraries, many of which are provided by the |GNU| Project. Many
      Linux distributions use the word *"Linux"* in their name, but the |FSF|
      uses the name **GNU/Linux** to emphasize the importance of |GNU|
      software, causing some controversy.

   C
      `C`_ is a general-purpose, imperative procedural computer programming
      language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and
      recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to
      provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map
      efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.
      C has been standardized by the |ANSI| *X3J11* since 1989 (**ANSI C**) and

   :abbr:`OCL (Object Constraint Language)`
      `OCL`_ is a declarative language describing rules applying to |UML|
      models and is now part of the |UML| standard but as separate document.
      Initially, :abbr:`OCL (Object Constraint Language)` was merely a
      formal specification language extension for |UML|. :abbr:`OCL (Object
      Constraint Language)` may now be used with any |MOF| meta-model,
      including |UML|, and is a precise text language that provides constraint
      and object query expressions on any such kind of meta-model that cannot
      otherwise be expressed by diagrammatic notation. :abbr:`OCL (Object
      Constraint Language)` is a key component of the new OMG standard
      recommendation for transforming models, the |QVT| specification.

   :abbr:`UML (Unified Modeling Language)`
      `UML`_ is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the
      field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard
      way to visualize the design of a system. In 1997, :abbr:`UML (Unified
      Modeling Language)` was adopted as a standard by the |OMG|, and has
      been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005, :abbr:`UML
      (Unified Modeling Language)` was also published by |ISO| as an
      approved standard.

      In 2007 with the release of UML 2.1.2, two new significant
      specifications for certain technology areas have split off.
      These are: |SysML|, |BPMN|.

   :abbr:`XML (Extensible Markup Language)`
      `XML`_ is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding
      documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
      The design of :abbr:`XML (Extensible Markup Language)` focuses on
      documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary
      data structures. Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of
      :abbr:`XML (Extensible Markup Language)`-based languages. The :abbr:`XML
      (Extensible Markup Language)` specification is standardized by the
      |W3C|/TR/XML since 1998 as an open standard.
