# Namespace packages are a mechanism for splitting a single Python package
# across multiple directories on disk which serves only as a container for
# subpackages. Namespace packages may have no physical representation, and
# specifically are not like a regular package because they will have no
# __init__.py file in Python 3.
# Python currently still provides the pkgutil.extend_path to denote a package
# as a namespace package. The recommended way of using it is to put:

from pkgutil import extend_path
__path__ = extend_path(__path__, __name__)

# Every distribution needs to provide the same contents in its __init__.py,
# so that extend_path is invoked independent of which portion of the package
# gets imported first. As a consequence, the package's __init__.py cannot
# practically define any names as it depends on the order of the package
# fragments on sys.path which portion is imported first. As a special feature,
# extend_path reads files named <packagename>.pkg which allow to declare
# additional portions.

# See: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/
# Relative imports must always use from <> import ; import <> is always
# absolute. Of course, absolute imports can use from <> import by omitting
# the leading dots.
