\begin{tikzpicture}

    % Define timelines with their names, and ordinate as #2:
    \tline{A}{2};
    \tline{B}{0};

    % Actually draw the timelines (#2 is the horizontal length):
    \ttimeline{A}{5};
    \ttimeline{B}{5};

    % Provide captions for timelines:
    \tcaption{A}{A's caption};
    \tcaption{B}{B's caption};

    % Draw the actual content:

    % tick = vertical line accros the timeline
    \ttick{A};

    % advance time
    \tskip{A}{2};

    % This one will be drawn 2 time units after the previous, because of
    % the \tskip:
    \ttick{A};

    % One more with the same principle:
    \tskip{A}{1};
    \ttick{A};

    % Same as above, but on timeline B:
    \ttick{B};
    \tskip{B}{1};

    % \tbox creates a box with non-null width, and text inside:
    \tbox{B}{3}{Box on B};
