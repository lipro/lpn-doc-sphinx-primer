   .. admonition:: Extension not applicable
      :class: danger

      This Sphinx extension is quite new and is under constant development.
      The current behavior disturbs the integration, so the extension is
      disabled for now (see :file:`conf.py`). Currently known bugs are:

      * annoying side effects with the :doc:`sphinx-tabs` extension by
	the automatically integrated and delivered Bootstrap 4.0 CSS
      * no proper and practical LaTeX builder support

.. only:: html and sphinx_panels

   .. _panels/example:

   :the example:

      .. literalinclude:: sphinx-panels-example.rsti
         :end-before: .. Local variables:
         :language: rst
         :linenos:

   :which gives:

      .. include:: sphinx-panels-example.rsti

.. Local variables:
   coding: utf-8
   mode: text
   mode: rst
   End:
   vim: fileencoding=utf-8 filetype=rst :
