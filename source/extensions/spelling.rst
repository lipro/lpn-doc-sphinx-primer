.. rst:directive:: spelling

   The :rst:`.. spelling::` directive can be used to create a list of words
   known to be spelled correctly within a single file. For example, if a
   document refers to a person or project by name, the name can be added
   to the list of known words for just that single document.

   When a more common list of words is needed, related to check multiple
   document at once, the :confval:`spelling_word_list_filename` variable
   should be set properly.

.. confval:: spelling_word_list_filename

   That is a list specifying files containing a list of words known to be
   spelled correctly but that do not appear in the refered language
   dictionary. The files should contain one word per line. Refer to the
   |PyEnchant| tutorial for details.
