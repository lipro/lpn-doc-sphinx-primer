Block Diagram Family
####################

`blockdiag <http://blockdiag.com/>`_ and its family generate diagram images
from simple text files:

.. blockdiag::

   blockdiag {
       blockdiag -> generates -> "block-diagrams";
       blockdiag -> is -> "very easy!";

       blockdiag [color = "greenyellow"];
       "block-diagrams" [color = "pink"];
       "very easy!" [color = "orange"];
   }

:Features:

   1. Supports many types of diagrams

      * block diagram (w/ :doc:`blockdiag <bldiag:blockdiag/sphinxcontrib>`)
      * sequence diagram (w/ :doc:`seqdiag <bldiag:seqdiag/sphinxcontrib>`)
      * activity diagram (w/ :doc:`actdiag <bldiag:actdiag/sphinxcontrib>`)
      * logical network diagram (w/ :doc:`nwdiag <bldiag:nwdiag/sphinxcontrib>`)
      * rack-structure diagram (w/ :doc:`rackdiag <bldiag:nwdiag/sphinxcontrib>`)
      * packet header diagram (w/ :doc:`packetdiag <bldiag:nwdiag/sphinxcontrib>`)

   2. Generates beautiful diagram images from simple text format
      (similar to Graphviz's ``dot`` format)
   3. Layouts diagram elements automatically
   4. Embeds to many documentations; |Sphinx|, Trac, Redmine,
      and some Wikis
   5. The output image format at generating |HTML| docs is either default
      |PNG| or |SVG| as prefered for this document.
   6. The output image format at generating |PDF| docs (through |LaTeX|) is
      either default |PNG| or |PDF| as prefered for this document. In case
      of |PDF|, the |ReportLab| library is required.
