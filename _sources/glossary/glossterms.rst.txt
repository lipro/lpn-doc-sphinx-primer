   reStructuredText
      `reStructuredText`_ (**RST**, **ReST**, or **reST**) is a file format
      for textual data used primarily in the |Python| programming language
      community for technical documentation. It is part of the |Docutils|
      project of the |Python| Doc-SIG (Documentation Special Interest Group).

   Docutils
      `Docutils`_ is an open-source text processing system for processing
      plaintext documentation into useful formats, such as |HTML|, |LaTeX|,
      man-pages, open-document or |XML|. It includes |reStructuredText|, the
      easy to read, easy to use, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext
      markup language.

   Sphinx
      `Sphinx`_ is a documentation generator written and used by the |Python|
      community. It is written in |Python|, and also used in other environments.
      Sphinx converts |reStructuredText| files into |HTML| websites and other
      formats including PDF, EPub, Texinfo and man.
      
      |reStructuredText| is extensible, and Sphinx exploits its extensible
      nature through a number of extensions |--| for auto generating
      documentation from source code, writing mathematical notation
      or highlighting source code, etc.

   LaTeX
      `LaTeX`_ is a document preparation system for high-quality
      typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical
      or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form
      of publishing. LaTeX uses the |TeX| typesetting program for
      formatting its output, and is itself written in the |TeX| macro
      language.

   :abbr:`POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)`
      `POSIX`_ is a family of standards specified by the |IEEE| Computer
      Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems.
      :abbr:`POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)` defines the
      |API|, along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for
      software compatibility with variants of |Unix| and other operating
      systems. :abbr:`POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)` has been
      standardized by the *Austin Group* since 1997 (|SUS|), and later since
      2001 by the |IEEE| Computer Society (**IEEE Std 1003.1**). Before 1997,
      POSIX comprised several standards.

           initially standardized in 1988 as *IEEE Std 1003.1-1988*

   Unix
      `Unix`_ (trademarked as UNIX\ |tm|) is a family of multitasking,
      multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original
      |AT&T| Unix, development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs
      research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. The
      origins of Unix date back to the mid-1960s when the |MIT|, Bell Labs
      and |GE| were developing *Multics*, a time-sharing operating system
      for a 36-bit mainframe computer. In the late 1980s, an open operating
      system standardization effort now known as |POSIX| provided a common
      baseline for all operating systems; |IEEE| based |POSIX| around the
      common structure of the major competing variants of the Unix system,
      publishing the first |POSIX| standard in 1988. In the early 1990s, a
      separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium,
      the |COSE| initiative, which eventually became the |SUS| administered by
      *The Open Group*. Starting in 1998, *The Open Group* and |IEEE| started
      the *Austin Group*, to provide a common definition of |POSIX| and the
      |SUS|, which, by 2008, had become the *Open Group Base Specification*.

   Linux
   |GNU|/Linux
      `Linux`_ (trademarked as Linux\ |tm|, handled by the |LMI|) is a family
      of open source |Unix|-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel,
      an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by
      Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.
      Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software
      and libraries, many of which are provided by the |GNU| Project. Many
      Linux distributions use the word *"Linux"* in their name, but the |FSF|
      uses the name **GNU/Linux** to emphasize the importance of |GNU|
      software, causing some controversy.

   C
      `C`_ is a general-purpose, imperative procedural computer programming
      language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and
      recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to
      provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map
      efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.
      C has been standardized by the |ANSI| *X3J11* since 1989 (**ANSI C**) and

      typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

      Alongside |HTML| and |CSS|, JavaScript is one of the core technologies
      of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is
      an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use

   TeX
      `TeX`_ is a computer language designed for use in typesetting system;
      in particular, for typesetting math and other technical material. It
      has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical
      systems and is also used for many other typesetting tasks, especially
      in the form of |LaTeX|, ConTeXt, and other macro packages.

      `MOF`_ is an |OMG| standard for model-driven engineering. Its purpose
      is to provide a type system for entities in the |CORBA| architecture
      and a set of interfaces through which those types can be created and
      manipulated.

   :abbr:`OCL (Object Constraint Language)`
      `OCL`_ is a declarative language describing rules applying to |UML|
      models and is now part of the |UML| standard but as separate document.
      Initially, :abbr:`OCL (Object Constraint Language)` was merely a
      formal specification language extension for |UML|. :abbr:`OCL (Object
      Constraint Language)` may now be used with any |MOF| meta-model,
      including |UML|, and is a precise text language that provides constraint
      and object query expressions on any such kind of meta-model that cannot
      otherwise be expressed by diagrammatic notation. :abbr:`OCL (Object
      Constraint Language)` is a key component of the new OMG standard
      recommendation for transforming models, the |QVT| specification.

   :abbr:`SysML (Systems Modeling Language)`

   :abbr:`UML (Unified Modeling Language)`
      `UML`_ is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the
      field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard
      way to visualize the design of a system. In 1997, :abbr:`UML (Unified
      Modeling Language)` was adopted as a standard by the |OMG|, and has
      been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005, :abbr:`UML
      (Unified Modeling Language)` was also published by |ISO| as an
      approved standard.

      In 2007 with the release of UML 2.1.2, two new significant
      specifications for certain technology areas have split off.
      These are: |SysML|, |BPMN|.

   :abbr:`XML (Extensible Markup Language)`
      `XML`_ is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding
      documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
      The design of :abbr:`XML (Extensible Markup Language)` focuses on
      documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary
      data structures. Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of
      :abbr:`XML (Extensible Markup Language)`-based languages. The :abbr:`XML
      (Extensible Markup Language)` specification is standardized by the
      |W3C|/TR/XML since 1998 as an open standard.
